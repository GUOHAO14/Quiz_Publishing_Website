# Quiz Publishing Website - Overview
This project is an assignment for Responsive Web Design & Development module in semester 4 of my diploma program at APU. It is a website developed as an online assessment and learning platform that can be utilised by educational institutions. Since it is a relatively small project and our team is still beginners in web development, the website is not published with a live server, instead it is a locally-hosted project. The development has involved four programming / scripting languages - HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. XAMPP (phpMyAdmin) is used as a localhost server. In order to retrieve data from XAMPP server, MySQL query language is used. 

The objective of the website is to:
1. Act as an alternative tool of teaching for teachers.
2. Eliminate rigid and traditional teaching methods.
3. Automate the answer verification process.
4. Analyse and summarise student performance.
5. To provide students with a reliable medium for online self-learning.


# Project Assumptions (And How It Works)
1. In contrast to regular online quiz and assessment websites, our project is designed specifically as a closed system for the use within an educational institution. Our intent is to provide a secure website for educational institutions, with which the quality of the quizzes are guaranteed. Details are as below:
  a. In the website’s initialisation, there is intentionally no sign up feature for account creation. Only the login feature is available.
  b. This is made so that the general public is not allowed to access the website. This is because by design, all accounts in the systems are pre-registered by website’s administrators.
  c. Only people within the institution in-use of the website own their respective accounts and can log in to the website with them.
  d. Each accounts is assigned with a specific role, such as student, teacher or admin. Different roles have their distinct user interface and functionalities. For example, exclusively the institution’s teachers and admins are certified to create online quizzes.
